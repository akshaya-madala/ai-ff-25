    Copilot Voice
Copilot Voice allows users to engage with Copilot in real-time voice conversations. The feature utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o model, which has the capability to understand and generate audio.[84]

Copilot Labs
In October 2024, an early-access program for features in-development, Copilot Labs, was revealed, exclusive to Microsoft Copilot Pro subscribers.[85] Features currently available through this program include "Think Deeper", which uses the OpenAI o1 models to let Copilot "reason" through more complex queries, and Copilot Vision, which lets Copilot view and converse about websites while browsing them. According to Microsoft, content used during Copilot Vision will not be stored or used to train models during the preview.

Languages
Copilot is able to communicate in numerous languages and dialects.[86][87] PCMag journalists conducted a test to determine translation capabilities of Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini, comparing them to Google Translate. They "asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test". Languages tested were Polish, French, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Tagalog, and Amharic. They concluded that Copilot performed better than Google Translate, but not as well as ChatGPT.[88] Japanese researchers compared Japanese-to-English translation abilities of Copilot, ChatGPT with GPT-4, and Gemini with those of DeepL, and found similar results, noting that "AI chatbots' translations were much better than those of DeepLâ€”presumably because of their ability to capture the context".[89] The markup language copilot uses for mathematical output is LaTeX.

Technology
Copilot utilizes the Microsoft Prometheus model. According to Microsoft, this uses a component called the Orchestrator, which iteratively generates search queries, to combine the Bing search index and results[90] with OpenAI's GPT-4,[91][92] GPT-4 Turbo,[93] and GPT-4o[94] foundational large language models, which have been fine-tuned using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
  Windows
Microsoft Copilot in Windows supports the use of voice commands. By default, it is accessible via the Windows taskbar.[95] Copilot in Windows is also able to provide information on the website currently being browsed by a user in Microsoft Edge.[96]

In 2024, Microsoft began to establish standards for "AI PCs" powered by Windows 11. These include a hardware AI accelerator, as well as a Copilot button on the keyboard, which replaces the menu key and launches Windows Search if Copilot is disabled or is not available in the user's region.[97][70] During a Microsoft Surface hardware event on May 20, 2024, Microsoft officially announced the "Copilot+ PC" branding.[98][99][100][101]

Mobile
Standalone Microsoft Copilot apps are available for Android[68] and iOS.[69]

Microsoft 365
Copilot can be used to rewrite and generate text based on user prompts in Microsoft 365 services, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and PowerPoint.[86][102] According to Jared Spataro, the head of Microsoft 365, Copilot for Microsoft 365 uses Microsoft Graph, an API, to evaluate context and available Microsoft 365 user data before modifying and sending user prompts to the language model.[103] After receiving its output, Microsoft Graph performs additional context-specific processing before sending the response to Microsoft 365 apps to generate content.[103]

According to Microsoft, Copilot can assist users with data analysis in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets by formatting data, creating graphs, generating pivot tables, identifying trends, and summarizing information, as well as guiding users using Excel commands and suggesting formulas to investigate user questions.[86][102] The company also states that Copilot is able to create PowerPoint presentations that summarize information from user-selected Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, or from user prompts.[102][104] Additionally, this tool can adjust text formatting, animation timing, and presentation style and length based on user prompts; Microsoft claims this will eliminate the need for users to make manual changes.[86][102]

In Microsoft Outlook, Copilot can draft emails with varying length and tone based on user input.[86] To draft these emails, Copilot can pull relevant information from other emails.[102] Copilot is also able to summarize content from email threads, including the viewpoints of involved individuals as well as questions posed that have yet to be answered.[86][102] According to Microsoft, Copilot can be used in Microsoft Teams to present information for upcoming meetings, transcribe meetings, and provide debriefs if a user joins a meeting late.[103] After a meeting, the company claims that Copilot can also summarize discussion points, list key actions deliberated in the meeting, and answer questions that were covered in the meeting.[102] The company has publicly introduced Microsoft 365 Chat, a Copilot feature which pulls information from content across Microsoft 365 apps, enabling it to answer user questions and perform other tasks.[102][103][105]

Reception
Tom Warren, a senior editor at The Verge, has noted the conceptual similarity of Copilot and other Microsoft assistant features like Cortana and Clippy.[86] Warren also believes that large language models, as they develop further, could change how users work and collaborate.[86] Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester, states that the integration of AI into productivity software may lead to improvements in user experience.[106]

Concerns over the speed of Microsoft's recent release of AI-powered products and investments have led to questions surrounding ethical responsibilities in the testing of such products.[60] One ethical concern the public has vocalized is that GPT-4 and similar large language models may reinforce racial or gender bias.[86] Individuals, including Tom Warren, have also voiced concerns for Copilot after witnessing the chatbot showcasing several instances of artificial hallucinations.[86] In June 2024, Copilot was found to have repeated misinformation about the 2024 United States presidential debates.[107]

In response to these concerns, Jon Friedman, the Corporate Vice President of Design and Research at Microsoft, stated that Microsoft was "applying [the] learning" from experience with Bing to "mitigate [the] risks" of Copilot.[86] Microsoft claimed that it was gathering a team of researchers and engineers to identify and alleviate any potential negative impacts.[60] The stated aim was to achieve this through the refinement of training data, blocking queries about sensitive topics, and limiting harmful information.[60] Microsoft stated that it intended to employ InterpretML and Fairlearn to detect and rectify data bias, provide links to its sources, and state any applicable constraints.[60]
